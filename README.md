# Module-4-Challenge

## Description

This application is a coding assessment made up of multiple choice questions. Javascript was used to give the application it's functionability. First variables were declared to keep track of the quiz state and also used to reference DOM elements. FUnctions were used throughout the code to execute certain parts of the application. These parts include getting the questions from the questions array, an event for the choices button, starting the timer and adding or subtracting time, saving the highscores and lastly ending the quiz.
